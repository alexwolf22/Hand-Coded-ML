# Support Vector Machine Algorithms
###### Use svm in primal form, primal sperable, and dual form to classify elements. A kernel is used for the dual form. 

Import this subdirectory into matlab and run 'SVM_primal_seperable_run',  'SVM_primal_run' ,and 'svm_dual_with_kernel_run' to see these algorithms work in action
